        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <h4>Pizza sauce ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 (12 ounce) of Tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried and crushed oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried and crushed basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Pizza crust ingredients (for 6 pizza slices)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3<span class="improperFraction">1/4</span> cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>.25 ounce pizza crust yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1<span class="improperFraction">1/2</span> teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1<span class="improperFraction">1/3</span> cups warm water (120-130 degrees farenheit</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Pizza crust ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 6 ounce pepperoni</li>
            <li>1<u>&lt</u> cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust.</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
            <li>Serve</li>
        </ol>
